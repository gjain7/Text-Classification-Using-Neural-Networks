# Text-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks
NLP based text classification is done based on neural networks.

## Methodology

Text classification is the task of assigning a sentences or document an appropriate category. The
categories depend on the chosen dataset and can range from topics.

Here I have used RNN nad LSTM for text Classification.

LSTM obtained better accuracy than RNN
